# AirportMap
This is a Lab 3 for Geog 371

This lab (Airports Map) contains many aspects of web mapping. We used many different concepts such as geojson, css, js and html. Which are contained in the subsequent folders. The map shows the location of airports with and without control towers. The map also uses a choropleth map to display the relative airport density per state. There are several map elements on this web map from two legends, a dynamic scale, zoom bar, clickable airports and distance measurement tool with flight fuel cost.
